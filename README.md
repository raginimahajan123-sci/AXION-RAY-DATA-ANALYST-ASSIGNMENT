# Automotive Failure Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing raw, real-world automotive industry data using Python. The dataset contains failure-related records with multiple categorical tags, inconsistent formatting, missing values, and noisy text fields.  
The objective of this analysis is to **clean, structure, and derive meaningful insights from unrefined data**, demonstrating practical data analytics skills relevant to industry use cases.

This repository is designed to showcase my proficiency in **Python, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation**, and is intended for sharing with potential employers.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Regex** – text standardization and anomaly handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – exploratory workflow  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset represents **automotive system failure records**, including:
- Failure condition tags  
- System and domain classifications  
- Raw text fields with encoding issues  
- Missing and inconsistent values  

The data required extensive preprocessing before meaningful analysis could be performed.

## 🔧 Key Steps Performed in the Analysis

### 1. Data Ingestion & Initial Exploration
- Loaded raw automotive failure data into Pandas DataFrames
- Inspected schema, data types, and basic statistics
- Identified missing values, corrupted characters, and inconsistent tagging

---

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Replaced unreadable or corrupted characters using regex patterns
- Standardized categorical tag fields (e.g., system tags, failure domains)
- Handled missing and undefined values by assigning meaningful placeholders
- Ensured consistency across multiple related columns

---

### 3. Feature Structuring & Tag Normalization
- Processed multi-label categorical fields for better interpretability
- Normalized tag values to reduce redundancy and ambiguity
- Prepared clean, analysis-ready datasets suitable for aggregation

---

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed frequency and distribution of failure conditions
- Examined system-level and domain-level failure trends
- Identified high-occurrence failure categories and patterns
- Explored relationships between different tagging dimensions

---

### 5. Insight Generation
- Highlighted dominant failure systems and domains
- Identified data quality issues common in industrial datasets
- Extracted insights that could support reliability analysis, root cause investigation, or reporting dashboards

## 📊 Visualizations
> *(Visuals will be added here)*

Planned visual outputs include:
- Failure frequency by system and domain
- Distribution plots of failure condition tags
- Bar charts highlighting top recurring issues
- Trend-based summaries for reporting

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings & Takeaways
- Hands-on experience working with **messy, real-world industrial data**
- Practical application of **regex-based cleaning and categorical normalization**
- Strong understanding of **EDA techniques for operational datasets**
- Ability to convert raw data into **structured, insight-driven outputs**
